# MorseTyper

This program is for those looking for a nice, efficient and easy place to learn non-audio Morse-Code. 
If you are a beginner, you should look at the cheat sheet first, then move to practising each 
character individually before attempting the quotes. 

To run the program, you must have access to a system that supports PowerShell (typically Windows, though PowerShell Core can run on other platforms like Linux and macOS), and you'll need the PowerShell interpreter installed. 

If you feel comfortable enough with Morse Code, of course you can start the quotes anytime you feel fit! 
Fun fact, we have over a thousand different quotes with varying lengths, so it's unlikely you will recieve the 
same quote twice! 

However, keep in mind that you should not put spaces inbetween any letters or words. You will only ever need to 
press , - and the backspace button whilst typing. 

If you ever want to exit back to the menu during your practise, you can enter in the lone character b, for back.

Other things to note...

If you get a quote wrong, it will immediately display the answer, unlike in the practise mode.
